## 1. Thermostat Prototype <a id="Thermostat"><a>
  <sub>Software Design and Engineering example</sub>

  ## - What is it?

This is a demonstration of an embedded c thermostat prototype concept that I have been working on to demonstrate my skill in working with embedded c and designing software. The thermostat utilizes a TI SimpleLink Wi-Fi CC3220S wireless microcontroller LaunchPad development kit to recreate a functional in-home thermostat. The software that I developed works with this device to allow it to read the current temperature of the room and will then turn on an LED to indicate taht the heat is on when the room temperature falls below the set temperature as if to imitate the homes heating turning on. It then uploads the temperature data and elapsed time since the device was started every one second to imitate a read out of the temperature on a physical thermostat.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MishievousCloud/MischievousCloud.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MishievousCloud/MischievousCloud.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
